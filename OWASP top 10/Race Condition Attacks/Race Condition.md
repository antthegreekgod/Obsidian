# Race Condition
Race Conditions are a type of vulnerability that may occur in computer systems where two or more processes/threads are competing for the same resources without an adequate synchronization mechanism to control access to them. This means that if two processes try to access the same shared resource at the same time, this can lead to  undesired behavior in the system or an unpredictable outcome.
