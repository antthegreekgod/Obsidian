*Improperly implemented permissions abuse occurs when the permissions of a critical file are set incorrectly*, allowing an unauthorized user to access or modify the file. This can allow an attacker to read sensitive information, modify important files, execute malicious commands or even gain superuser access to the system. Thus, an experienced attacker could take advantage of this flaw to elevate his privileges in the best case scenario. One of the tools in charge of applying this recognition on the system is '**lse**'. **Linux Smart Enumeration (LSE)** is a *security enumeration tool for Linux-based operating systems*, designed to help system administrators and security auditors identify and assess vulnerabilities and weaknesses in system configuration.
